    "Eastbound was founded in 2006 on a simple premise: that the best travel experiences are built from the ground up, by people who live in the destinations they design for, not by people looking at them from a head office overseas. What began as a specialist boutique has grown, over two decades, into a full destination management group spanning five countries — serving luxury tour operators, incentive houses and educational institutions worldwide.",
    "That founding philosophy — local intelligence, meticulous planning and hands-on execution — still shapes every itinerary Eastbound builds today, from a single-traveller birding expedition to a 200-delegate incentive programme.",
